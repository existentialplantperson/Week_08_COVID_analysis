# Week_08_COVID_analysis

Project specifications:

## Due Wednesday, November 10th, 2021. Presentations will occur on this day

1. Come up with at least one hypothesis or question about your data and no more than five. 
Example: What is the relationship between airline stocks and covid cases?

2. Store your data to check your hypothesis/answer your question(s) in one or more Pandas dataframes. 
Be concise and document your code clearly.

3. Create 2-3 visuals per hypothesis or question, and use basic statistics to explore your data. There is not only one right answer
for how to explore your data.

4. Create a presentation that is 5-8 minutes, which explains your findings. You will be giving this presentation
on the due date. 

## Deliverables

You must submit a link to your group github repository with:

1. A jupyter notebook with all your analysis and visualizations in it.

2. A ppt presentation with at least 4 slides and no more than 15. 

3. PowerPoint presentation in 5-8 minutes on the due date. Longer presentations are not necessarily better. It **must** stay under 8 minutes.


### Guidelines for your notebook:

- Write up an executive summary of your findings using `markdown`. 
- Use `markdown` throughout your notebook to tell the story of your data.
- All graphs should have Titles, labels and matching color schemes where applicable.
- Code should be neat and well documented. 
- Use different types of graphs
